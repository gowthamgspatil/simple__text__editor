This code implements a simple text editor using Python that works through the command line.

1. **File Operations**:
   - The `read_file` function reads the content of a file and returns it.
   - The `write_file` function writes a given string to a file, overwriting any existing content.

2. **User Input**:
   - The `get_user_input` function allows the user to type multiple lines of text, which are collected into a list. The process continues until the user types `SAVE` on a new line, signaling the end of input.

3. **Program Flow**:
   - In the `main` function:
     - The user specifies a filename to open or create.
     - If the file exists, its content is displayed to the user. If not, an empty file is created.
     - The user provides input (their text) via `get_user_input`.
     - The input is then saved to the specified file.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If there is an issue accessing the file (e.g., insufficient permissions or invalid file name), an error message is displayed.

5. **Execution**:
   - The program starts with the `main` function when executed, allowing the user to read, edit, and save text in a file via the command line.
