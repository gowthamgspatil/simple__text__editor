This Python program is a simple text editot designed to allow a user to read and edit a text file using a command-line interface. 

1. Imports

                         import os

The os module is imported to work with file system operations, such as checking if a file exists.


2. Function Definition

[     read_file(filename)   ]


                        def read_file(filename):
                            with open(filename, 'r') as file:
                            return file.read()

Purpose: 
                     Opens the specified file in read mode (`'r'`) and returns its content as a string.

Key Elements:
                      with open: Ensures the file is properly closed after it is read.
                      Returs the file's content to the caller.


[       write_file(filename, content)          ]

                       def write_file(filename, content):
                             with open(filename, 'w') as file:
                             file.write(content)


 Purpose: 
                      Opens the file in write mode (w) and writes the given content to the file. If the file doesn't exist, it creates it.

Key Elements:
                     Overwrites any existing content in the file.
                     file.write(content): Writes the string content to the file.



[        get_user_input()      ]

def get_user_input():
    print('\nEnter your text (type SAVE on a new line to save and exit):')
    
                      lines = []
                         while True:
                      line = input()
                        if line == 'SAVE':
                            break
                      lines.append(line)
    
                     return '\n'.join(lines)


Purpose:
                    Collects multiple lines of input from the user until they type `SAVE` on a new line.

Key Elements:
                    Prompts the user to type text.
                    Uses a loop to read input line by line.
                    Appends each line to a list (`lines`).
                   Returns all collected lines joined into a single string separated by newline characters (`\n`).

3. Main Program Logic

 [     main()    ]

                    def main():
                       filename = input('Enter the filename to open or create: ').strip()
                       try:
                       if os.path.exists(filename):
                          print(read_file(filename))
                      else:
                           write_file(filename, '')

                          content = get_user_input()
                          write_file(filename, content)
                            print(f'{filename} saved.')
                         except OSError:
                         print(f'{filename} could not be opened.')

Purpose: 
                         The main entry point of the program, which:
                                   1. Asks the user to specify a filename.
                                   2. Checks if the file exists:
                                           - If it exists, displays its current content by calling read_file.
                                           - If it does not exist, creates an empty file by calling write_file(filename, '').
                                   3. Invokes get_user_input() to allow the user to enter new content.
                                   4. Saves the content to the file by calling write_file.
                                   5. Handles file-related errors using try-except.

Error Handling:

                            except OSError:
                            print(f'{filename} could not be opened.')

 If any file operation (like opening or writing) fails due to a file system error, this block ensures the program doesnâ€™t crash and provides feedback to the user.


4. Execution Block

                     if __name__ == '__main__':
                         main()
